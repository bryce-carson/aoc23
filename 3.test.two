The file contains at least two new line characters.
Symbols occur on the fifteenth and sixteenth non-control characters, but these are on the second line, and so are offset forwards one character because of the newline.
With the newlines removed, offset calculations become easier, in which case the symbols are indeed the fifteenth and sixteenth characters in the input string.
